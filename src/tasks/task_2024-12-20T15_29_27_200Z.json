            "The `app_local.php` changes added more specific database connection details, these need to be checked to be correct and working before proceeding to the next step, also the quotes identifiers should be reviewed.",

          "Ensure error handling and implement retry mechanisms for failed webhook calls, also implement a queue system if the number of webhooks is too high.",
          "Design webhook payload to include relevant user and action data, including translated text based on user's locale if needed.",
          "Review and correct database connection details in `app_local.php` to ensure they're working before proceeding. Pay close attention to the `quoteIdentifiers` setting.",
          "Review the email configuration in `app_local.php` and complete it if needed for future email features.",
          "Utilize the `debug` flag for development purposes, but disable it in production.",
          "Keep the configuration files well-organized and avoid mixing hardcoded values with environment variables.",
          "Before implementing, research best practices for webhook security, like verifying webhook signatures using secrets. Implement that from the beginning to avoid future security problems.",
          "When implementing, make sure to create an API endpoint to receive webhooks from third parties, and also create a way to verify that requests are coming from the allowed third parties."
